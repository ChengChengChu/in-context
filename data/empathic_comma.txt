SpeakerA: I am applying to graduate school and I am a little anxious about it!
SpeakerB: Oh, don't be! Just have faith in yourself and be confident that you can make it in. 
SpeakerA: The interview is what is making me nervous!
SpeakerB: I see, think of it as having a conversation with a friend. It will make it easier! 
====================
SpeakerA: I am waiting to see if I pass the GRE.
SpeakerB: I hope you did it. Don't worry too much.
SpeakerA: Thank you, I am trying my best. 
SpeakerB: If you need to you can always take it again. Good luck!
====================
SpeakerA: What a scary night that was.
SpeakerB: What happened? Hope you are okay?
SpeakerA: My house burned night earlier, had to get my mom out.
SpeakerB: Omg that is so scary, I am so sorry to hear that. 
====================
SpeakerA: i was inbed last night and heard a loud bang in the kitchen
SpeakerB: Did you get up to check it out?
SpeakerA: yeah i was sneaking in there when i found the cat looking as guilty as can be
SpeakerB: That would have scared me. At least it wasnt an intruder.
====================
SpeakerA: My apartment complex is nickel and diming me and counting off so many things wrong with the apartment to detract from my security deposit as I get set to leave after this month. I know people said to expect to never see your security deposit again, but this is ridiculous! I feel like the apartment is pretty much exactly the same
SpeakerB: I hate when that happens! The same thing happened to me when I moved out of my apartment. They kept my security deposit because they needed to replace carpet.
SpeakerA: It's a racket. The building is from the 1950s and has hardly been updated. Of course everything is going to look like crap. They just splash the cheapest white paint everywhere. At least there's no carpet in mine that would need to be replaced. Bleh
SpeakerB: Mine hadn't been replaced in 6 years, I found that out after the fact. 
====================
SpeakerA: I lost my swim bottoms going down the slide at the water park.
SpeakerB: Haha.. I feel like that's almost a rite of passage when going to water parks. I've had that happen, too. Hopefully it wasn't too traumatic for you. I almost lost my glasses once, too! Now that was really scary
SpeakerA: It was horrible, but I recovered! No shame.
SpeakerB: That's the spirit. It's good that you don't take yourself too seriously. Heck, my roommate walked in on me doing some "self-pleasure" just yesterday.. I used to think that was my worst nightmare, but in the moment I just did my best to laugh it off so we could move forward faster
====================
SpeakerA: I get so flustered whenever there is a training class at work and I have to get up in front of everyone and walk out.  I dread if I have to use the restroom or get water!
SpeakerB: Ugh that must so inconvenient and uncomfortable! 
SpeakerA: It really is, I just have social anxiety really bad I think.
SpeakerB: I can relate, I get red face when ever I have to come infront of the class to present. 
====================
SpeakerA: My friend just won a lottery and got tickets to the Superbowl and I lost! 
SpeakerB: Oh gosh, is he going to take you to the Superbowl at least?
SpeakerA: I dont think he can since he only won one ticket. I am beyond jealous right now but also happy for him since he really wants to go. 
SpeakerB: Just one ticket, that sounds lonely for him.
====================
SpeakerA: I saw this creepy looking clown peering in my window the other night. I almost jumped out of my skin.
SpeakerB: Oh no, I would have had a heart attack.
SpeakerA: I ran into the basement and hid in a closet. I have been down here ever since. At least I got Internet access.
SpeakerB: Sell the house!
====================
SpeakerA: my boyfriend took me to a haunted house 
SpeakerB: Nice, how was it?
SpeakerA: no it was scary!
SpeakerB: Hope you're all right!
====================
SpeakerA: My friends just recently purchased a brand new, new car smelling, 2019 Honda Civic.
SpeakerB: Yikes! Bet the car payment is not worth it. lol
SpeakerA: Well, for me, I am honestly angry.  I look at their success and feel it should be me!  
SpeakerB: Sometimes jealousy can become us. But most times it does not pay to be that way, cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right
SpeakerA: You are probably right.  I feel like such a terrible friend for feeling that way.  Nevertheless, it is a little motivation for me to work that much harder.  
====================
SpeakerA: Just had to tell mom I stole some candies,
SpeakerB: Woah, hope she doesn't report you! Jk
SpeakerA: I hope so too, but I feel quite guilty regarding it,
SpeakerB: I see, hope she is able to understand!
====================
SpeakerA: Sometimes I feel like I have so much going on that I feel overwhelmed and over ran with anxiety that it makes it hard to stay focused on everything
SpeakerB: I totally understand.  Life can sometimes seem overwhelming.  I have learned to stop, take a deep breath, and do one thing at a time.
SpeakerA: That makes sense. I am going to start trying that more
SpeakerB: It's just a way to calm the body and the mind.  It is SO easy to fall into the trap of anxiety.  But falling there doesn't accomplish a thing.  Take a breath, focus on one small success, then move to the next.  
====================
SpeakerA: my dog is sick we took him into the vet and now we are playing the waiting game
SpeakerB: I am sorry to hear that! My dog is a part of the family, so I understand. I hope everything is okay.
SpeakerA: yeah it is scary to think we could lose him...
SpeakerB: It is scary to think about, I hope for the best!
====================
SpeakerA: I didn't get a big promotion at work, I worked so hard for it.
SpeakerB: Sorry to hear that, I know that you probably feel disappointed but there will be other opportunities! 
SpeakerA: I was,but I will try harder next time.
SpeakerB: Yes, and you will succeed eventually. 
====================
SpeakerA: Football season is about to start. I used to always watch the opening day games with my dad. I'm halfway across the country now though, and we won't be able to do it in person for a long time. Makes me miss him
SpeakerB: Oh dang, that is too bad.  Can you guys video call?
SpeakerA: Eh, we're not really the type to do that. Especially not him. And it's not worth it. Just a phone call here or there. Just miss the tradition is all. We're big family people
SpeakerB: Oh OK, hopefully you have some friends you can bring over and share your traditions.
====================
SpeakerA: I found my grandfathers old watch he used to wear all the time. It really reminds me of him a lot.
SpeakerB: That is pretty neat especially if it gives you good memories!
SpeakerA: It really does. I remember he used to wear it for special occasions and holidays.
SpeakerB: Now you can carry on that tradition.
====================
SpeakerA: My friend just got a new job
SpeakerB: That's great! Where are they working?
SpeakerA: Health care place. Except they're earning more than me in the same field, even though I am way more qualified
SpeakerB: That's got to be frustrating. Have you thought of maybe working at the same place?
====================
SpeakerA: I felt so embarrassed yesterday.
SpeakerB: Why, what happened to make you feel that
SpeakerA: I walked out of the bathroom with some toilet paper stuck to my shoe.
SpeakerB: Nice, I never understood why that's embarassing haha
====================
SpeakerA: When I was at gym, my pants has torn from behind. I felt bad about it.
SpeakerB: Oh wow that sucks! Hope it wasn't too embarassing!
SpeakerA: It was very embarassing. There was people looking at me and other laughing at me.
SpeakerB: Oh wow I'm sorry! That's not cool, they would be hurt if people were laughing at them
====================
SpeakerA: I went to an old part of town and these guys really scared me.
SpeakerB: Oh no, next time you should bring a friend to be safe.
SpeakerA: I know that's smart i should not have gone alone.
SpeakerB: It's okay, you got out fine this time!
====================
SpeakerA: My coworker in the cubicle next to me is always talking! He really bothers me.
SpeakerB: What does he normally talk about?
SpeakerA: Dumb stuff that has nothing to do with work!
SpeakerB: Oh yeah, that really is a waste of time
====================
SpeakerA: I am so nervous right now.   I......I don't know what to do
SpeakerB: Whats going to happen?
SpeakerA: I heard a loud crash in my backyard.  I think it's the aliens.
SpeakerB: Oh gosh, i think it was just a tree falling i bet.
SpeakerA: No.  I looked out the window and they literally said..."it's the aliens"
====================
SpeakerA: My 15 year old stole a family members bank card number and overdrawn the account by $500. I was so mad I asked him about it and he had the nerve to lie to me even with the proof that I needed
SpeakerB: Ugh teenagers can be so troublesome some times! I hope you made him realize what he did was wrong. 
SpeakerA: Oh I did. I was always told that newborn years was the worse but raising know it all teens is the worse, makes me miss the newborn stage
SpeakerB: Yup, but what I don't like about that age is having to stay up all night!
====================
SpeakerA: I found out my storage unit burned down and I had lost several irreplaceable items
SpeakerB: Was the fire set by someone or an accident?
SpeakerA: It was an accident at the storage faciltiy
SpeakerB: That's horrible, i am sorry!
====================
SpeakerA: Ew what a gross wound my brother had.
SpeakerB: How did he get it?
SpeakerA: He crashed his bike and cut it up badly, it was disgusting.
SpeakerB: I hope it wasn't too painful for him and he disinfected and bandaged that wound up.
====================
SpeakerA: We had someone break into our hom.
SpeakerB: Oh my god! Are you ok? was anyone home? Did they take anything important?
SpeakerA: We are okay and thankfully we were not home. They went through everything, but didn't take anything. 
SpeakerB: That's weird. I am happy you have your possesions.
====================
SpeakerA: I am jealous of my coworker, he is very smart and athletic
SpeakerB: you can train and get better
SpeakerA: I can, but I cannot get any smarter
SpeakerB: i thin yyouca you just have to believe in yursef
====================
SpeakerA: i went to see the boo of mormon ans i did not think it was that ood
SpeakerB: Why is that?
SpeakerA: i just did not think it came together well overall
SpeakerB: I get that, too bad we cannot refund movies
====================
SpeakerA: I was cut off this morning on the way to work. It caused me to crash into the ditch. I am so mad.
SpeakerB: Is the car terribly damaged?
SpeakerA: I had to get it towed to the shop. We will see how bad it is. 
SpeakerB: I hope it will be ok. Were you late for your work?
====================
SpeakerA: My license got lost in the mail and I had to go back to the dmv to get a new one.
SpeakerB: That sucks, it takes so long for them to arrive!
SpeakerA: It does and the wait at the dmv is always long. I was so irritated.
SpeakerB: Hope everything works out for you!
====================
SpeakerA: My 12 year old lab just passed away. He was my buddy and I am really upset about losing him.
SpeakerB: That is so sad. Dogs become part of the family so when something like that happens it is like losing a family member
SpeakerA: It really is.  I am just so broken up over it.
SpeakerB: I am so sorry for your loss, within time you will heal. Just try to cherish the memories that you was left with, Think about all the good times
====================
SpeakerA: My best friend's grandmother passed away. 
SpeakerB: Oh my, sorry to hear that. How is he holding up?
SpeakerA: Doing okay, just a lot to process.
SpeakerB: I am sure it is. Just need to give him time and support right now. 
====================
SpeakerA: Just got my marks back.
SpeakerB: What are those? Your grades?
SpeakerA: My math test grades, i failed the test somehow.
SpeakerB: Math was always my least favorite. Are you British?
====================
SpeakerA: My husband will be away on a trip for the weekend and it will be so quiet without him here.
SpeakerB: Aww i'm sorry. Maybe enjoy a glass of wine and watch some girly shows. My husband is in the military and gone a lot so I feel for you.
SpeakerA: Thank your husband for his service! We appreciate him!
SpeakerB: Aww thank you, means a lot! 
====================
SpeakerA: A mosquito has been flying around my face all day and its really starting to get to me.
SpeakerB: Don't you just hate that?!
SpeakerA: I do! I am beyond annoyed and will try to obliterate it with my hand if I see it again.
SpeakerB: Just remember, it is probably a female mosquito.  They are the ones interested in your blood.  Not the males.  
====================
SpeakerA: I feel horrible. I let go of all of my friends and don't know how to move forward.
SpeakerB: Sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends?
SpeakerA: They live a drug culture.
SpeakerB: Good job for realizing that because such people are a bad influence. Join some outdoor or interest clubs and you might just find new friends. 
====================
SpeakerA: I was cut off today and crashed my car into a pole to avoid colliding with someone.
SpeakerB: Oh no! Are you ok?
SpeakerA: I am, just a little bit winded. Also very angry that the person just drove away like nothing happened!
SpeakerB: Yea i would be too! That is a horrible person.
====================
SpeakerA: I got really upset when I got home today and my cat pooped on the bed.
SpeakerB: Gross!  I would have been super mad if my cat did that!  What did you do?
SpeakerA: I had to clean it up, but not before I yelled at her and showed her what she did.
SpeakerB: Yeah, I would have done the some.  Hopefully that never happens to you again.
====================
SpeakerA: My wife has out of town for a couple weeks and we just moved to this city. I feel so bored and have no one to hang out with.
SpeakerB: Oh no, maybe try going to reddit and ask people what to do in your city!
SpeakerA: That's actually a really good idea!  I am always on reddit anyways!
SpeakerB: Hahaha, me too, it's such a time sink. This week when it was down for a couple hours I really felt like I had nothing else to browse.
====================
SpeakerA: I was scared last week driving home. My car was driving weird
SpeakerB: Uh oh! How was it driving weird?
SpeakerA: The handling was harder than usual
SpeakerB: Yikes! My old Ford Focus had a similar issue. It turned out to be really bad alignment and ended up putting a hole in our front tire. 
====================
SpeakerA: I clogged the toilet at work yesterday. I had to take a huge dump and there was nothing to do about it. The toilet couldn't handle it. I couldn't fix it, either. So, I just quietly whisked away. I feel bad for the janitor that has to deal with it
SpeakerB: yeah but that is his ob
SpeakerA: That's true. But I wish there was something I could have done to make it easier on him. I've always had random small talk with him, and he's the nicest person. I just feel like a gross slob.
SpeakerB: yeah im not sure i could every take that job
====================
SpeakerA: i was at a rangers game and this guy attacked a kid over the shirt he was wearing
SpeakerB: That sounds like an uncomfortable situation. What ended up happening? I kind of avoid large crowds and sports events because of this, since there's usually alcohol involved.
SpeakerA: yeah it just made me upset so i had a argument with him
SpeakerB: Oh, so you got involved? Were you trying to protect the kid? If so, I can understand that, and that's noble. Hopefully nothing too negative came from the situation.
====================
SpeakerA: When my husband and I first got together he use to talk to his ex girlfriend all the time cause she was with one of his friends. I despised that woman
SpeakerB: Yikes, that's very disrespectful. I hope you told him how you feel about that.
SpeakerA: I did, he said she did not mean anything to him and stopped going over to his friends house 
SpeakerB: That's good, at least he learned from that. I hope you guys are going strong now!
====================
SpeakerA: When I came home from work yesterday, the front door was open and the lock broken.
SpeakerB: Someone broke in?
SpeakerA: Looks like it. I was so afraid that I instantly called the police and went to my neighbors house until they arrived. 
SpeakerB: Good thinking.  Sounds like you should get yourself a new house
====================
SpeakerA: I hate parents that censor every TV show, movie, video game, or song on the radio. Of course it's one thing to let a 5-year-old watch "Silence of the Lambs"; but do you really expect to raise the next Einstein by blinding him to the real world? By the time he's 13 he or she's gonna have some serious repression issues and grow up to be a weirdo
SpeakerB: I agree, such helicopter parents exercise far too much control on their kids, doing more harm than good in the long run.
SpeakerA: Yes I'm glad you see it that way.  Which is why I think despite all the shortcomings Millenials have we're probably going to be the best generation of parents in history lol
SpeakerB: I completely agree. Unfortunately we also have to clean up the mess made by our parent generation.. you know like climate change exists! 
====================
SpeakerA: I was on a train in Sri Lanka. I asked the passengers if I was at the right stop. They told me no. Turns out I was at the right place.
SpeakerB: Oh dang. Do you think it was intentional?
SpeakerA: I dont think they understood what I was asking.
SpeakerB: Oh that stinks. I bet you were pretty mad?
SpeakerA: A little bit, but I have a problem  assuming everyone speaks English in a foreign county that I visit.
====================
SpeakerA: This week, my manager told me bad comments about my work performance. It made me feel bad.
SpeakerB: that isnt good, were they true?
SpeakerA: No, there were not. The project is not making progress as expected mainly because he is bad manager. He is trying to find excuses.
SpeakerB: That is terrible, is there someone above him you can go to?
====================
SpeakerA: Im so upset me sister gets to stay out as late as she wants but i have to be in at 8 PM its not fair
SpeakerB: Dear lord, how old are you?
SpeakerA: Does it really matter? I mean I feel like they have always played favorites.
SpeakerB: I was joking. I havent a curfew since I was 17. Im an only child so wouldnt know much about favorites.
====================
SpeakerA: I was staying at a hostel and forgot to lock my backpack. I woke up the next day with money missing.
SpeakerB: O no did you report it to the hospital
SpeakerA: Hostel. Theyre not responsible for lost items.
SpeakerB: That is not ok I would make go to a higher up
SpeakerA: Its fine. It wasnt alot of money. I just dont like people taking my things.
====================
SpeakerA: i hate when the person behind me in ine is so close
SpeakerB: What do you mean?
SpeakerA: like standing all in my space
SpeakerB: Oh they're in your bubble. that stinks, some people are weird like that, no bounderies.
====================
SpeakerA: My dog of 10 years recently passed away.
SpeakerB: I truly do feel bad that you have to endure that. My girlfriend and I were just talking about how horrible she's going to feel when she loses her Havanese pup at some point in the distant future, since she's so close to her. I hope you can grieve the loss of your great friend in a healthy way.
SpeakerA: Thank you very much. Yes, it's always really hard to lose a pet you are so close to. My finacee is urging me to get another puppy to help the feeling pass.
SpeakerB: I can appreciate why they'd say that. They just want you to feel better. But it's all about to how you're feeling. You'll know in your gut when to get another pet, if you ever want to get another one. It's important to take the time to reflect on your lost relationship.
====================
SpeakerA: I remember the first time i got in the rattler roller coaster in san antonio , my anxiety was through the roof
SpeakerB: How'd it go?
SpeakerA: i never want to get on it ever again , it was really scary , its made out of wood and super shaky 
SpeakerB: Sounds like an old coaster they should consider replacing.
====================
SpeakerA: I have had so much to get together for my grad school application.
SpeakerB: What school are you applying to?
SpeakerA: I am applying to NYU.
SpeakerB: That is a tough school to get into. Best of luck.
====================
SpeakerA: i was scared walking home alone last weekend
SpeakerB: Oh no. Did anything happen?
SpeakerA: no but it was extremely dark
SpeakerB: Hopefully, you won't have to walk when it's dark out again or at least have people to walk with you.
====================
SpeakerA: This is so creepy, I dont know if im going to be able to sleep tonight.
SpeakerB: What is so creepy
SpeakerA: I am home alone right now and I just heard a noise upstairs.  I dont want to go up there.
SpeakerB: I am sure you are finr
====================
SpeakerA: I ruined my moms anniversary party.
SpeakerB: Oh no, what happened?
SpeakerA: I dropped their anniversary cake when bringin it in. IT was everywhere
SpeakerB: It happens, you can't beat yourself up about it, it was an accident!
SpeakerA: She said it was okay, but what a terrible memory.
====================
SpeakerA: I saw a kitten hurt on the side of the road... unfortunately I was in a taxi and couldn't stop to help it
SpeakerB: That would have made me sad , poor kitten 
SpeakerA: Yeah that was a few years ago and it still makes me sad
SpeakerB: I love animals , i would feel the same as you
====================
SpeakerA: I'm really anxious for my upcoming job interview.
SpeakerB: Thats understandable! Just be yourself and Im sure you will do great!
SpeakerA: Thanks, I'm going to try to do my best. I really want this job!
SpeakerB: A tip someone gave me once is to make sure to have really good posture as it makes you appear less nervous! Fake it till you make it! Good luck!
====================
SpeakerA: When I was younger, I went on a trip to my cousins ski home in New York. I am from Florida and didn't know any better and stuck my tongue to a frozen pole when one of my cousins dared me to. I dont recommend it.
SpeakerB: Oh no, that classic prank! I bet that was painful, I've only seen it on movies.
SpeakerA: Haha well fortunately my cousin was like "Oh [BLEEP] I didnt think you were actually going to do it. [BLEEP]" He was like, dont move not even a millicentimeter, Ill be right back!! And came back with a warm sponge and warm water! 
SpeakerB: Haha, wow, that's awesome.  Sort of makes up for him playing that prank on you.
====================
SpeakerA: I'm ashamed that I don't have more in my savings then I currently do.
SpeakerB: cheer up buddy, everyone have experienced that at one point or the other
SpeakerA: Thanks, you're right, I just need to start budgeting and saving more.
SpeakerB: no worries buddy, the experience will make you stronger
====================
SpeakerA: I recently made a move across states for work, but am having trouble meeting new friends out here.
SpeakerB: Making new friends can be tough, is there anyone at work you bond with?
SpeakerA: Not sure yet as I just met them recently, but I am hoping that work provides a way for me to meet some people.
SpeakerB: I am sure that you will meet some new friends@
====================
SpeakerA: Once in a dream I was shot, died and everything faded to black
SpeakerB: That must've been terrifying in your dream.
SpeakerA: Yes! truly though I died,  I woke up very confused for a moment.
SpeakerB: I hope you don't have many of those dreams again.
====================
SpeakerA: i was scared walking home yesterday

SpeakerA: Luckily nothing was taken.
====================
SpeakerA: Every time I try to eat dinner, a salesman calls me on the phone.
SpeakerB: That is so annoying.  I thought they were not supposed to be allowed to call anymore.
SpeakerA: They still do even thou I am on the do not call list.
SpeakerB: I heard they are based outside of the country and make calls out of reach of the law.  Like I said, ANNOYING!

SpeakerB: yes and staying away from addicts is always good as well! Pick a different hobby for sure that's healthy is good!
SpeakerA: Yup.  I'm guessing you're a homebody yourself
SpeakerB: YES! I used to be very social but I have had enough of that and now I am happy to be at home and at peace :0
====================
SpeakerA: During a work meeting, I was presenting and two coworker keep talking to each other. It was bothering me.
SpeakerB: That's really rude of them, I guess no one taught them manners.
SpeakerA: I am shy and I didn't find the way to say to them politely to stop.
SpeakerB: Someone else should have looked out for you, though.
====================

SpeakerB: I'm sorry to hear that. Well, I hope it's over with soon.
====================
SpeakerA: There a guy parked right in front of my house the past few hours. He keeps looking towards my house, I'm getting kind of freaked out.
SpeakerB: That's creepy, do you think you're in trouble for something or is it someone random?
SpeakerA: It seems like someone random. I have a bad feeling about it. I think i'm going to call the police. 
SpeakerB: I would do so just as a precaution, can never be too careful!
====================
SpeakerA: I'm annoyed with all the political talk and drama! I know everyone has an opinion, I just don't need to hear it.
SpeakerB: I feel the same way! I mean, my Facebook feed is full of all this garbage.
SpeakerA: Right! I just wish people kept it to themselves.
SpeakerB: I actually use a special extension on my browser so I can block certain things like this on my Facebook! You should try it!
====================
SpeakerA: I have a meeting with my boss for my yearly evaluation tomorrow morning, yikes!

SpeakerB: That's always a nice alternative, could be worse.
====================
SpeakerA: My almost 16 year old daughter wants to get her ear cartilage pierced.
SpeakerB: Oh, how do you feel about that?
SpeakerA: I'm not so sure, it has to be done at a tattoo shop and we didn't have such a great experience when she was little and had her ears pierced.  I'm thinking it's more of a "follow the crowd" kinda thing than her truly wanting it.
SpeakerB: Are you going to allow it then?
====================
SpeakerA: I was working on a really tough and boring project. When I was done my boss didn't even care. 
SpeakerB: Wow. Sounds like you have a wonderful boss. Sarcasm by the way.
SpeakerA: Yeah he's a catch. 
SpeakerB: Is he always this way?
SpeakerA: Yes, but hopefully he will be gone soon. He is retiring. 
====================
SpeakerA: I was nervous driving this evening. The traffic was so bad
SpeakerB: Seems like a silly thing to be nervous about, unless you're a terrible driver.
SpeakerA: Its not silly at all actually
SpeakerB: Well, to each their own. They have driving classes if you ever feel like you need them.
====================
SpeakerA: I haven't seen a horror movie in so long. I don't know if I can take watching one this weekend with my friends
SpeakerB: I am with you on that one
SpeakerA: Not a fan of horror either?
SpeakerB: I hate it
====================
SpeakerA: My friend is moving away, I am going to miss her so much. I can't help but cry a little when I think about it.
SpeakerB: Aw sorry to hear that...why is she moving
SpeakerA: A new job offer so I don't blame her
SpeakerB: nice well if you keep in touch everyday maybe it won't feel so far
====================
SpeakerA: Going to the store today was a bit hard. 
SpeakerB: It was? What made it hard specifically? Hopefully nothing too bad happened.
SpeakerA: Not too bad! I do not like big stores or being around people sometimes but you still have to run errands. I just swallow the panic on those days as best as I can.
SpeakerB: Yeah, I'm with you. I hate going to especially Walmart, because it's so freaking crowded all the time. It's a hassle getting even the shortest shopping list. But I'm on a budget and it's where I have to go.
SpeakerA: Try the big A store online as it is cheaper then walmart a lot. Do you know you can get pickup also at walmart for free? Helps if you don't want to shop there. I feel you on that- I don't like big stores especially!
SpeakerB: Thanks for the awesome tip. I appreciate you trying to think of an alternative for me! I'll give it a look.
====================
SpeakerA: Girlfriend found a lump in her throat. She has no idea what it could be. Has a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Not sure how forward I am looking to finding out the results, but I guess it's better than leaving it up to my imagination
SpeakerB: Very true! Maybe a gioter and she needs more minerals, thats what it is a lot.
SpeakerA: She's had other health issues in the past, so maybe they're related. Either way, she's a worrier, so now she's non-stop pacing and looking stuff up online. It's all I can do to help her even get a few hours of sleep.
SpeakerB: yes! Research is a life saver, never just rely on doctors..they almost killed me and many I know. I hope it's not too bad!
====================
SpeakerA: I feel guilty for smoking in the house today when it was raining outside.
SpeakerB: Almost all my family members have smoked at one point in time. I feel bad for the people that get caught in the addiction, and I wish I could help them quit. Sorry to hear it's such a hassle enough that you had to do it inside.
SpeakerA: It's a horrible addiction that I always keep putting off correcting.  I plan to make an effort to quit tomorrow.
SpeakerB: Hey, I really hope you do. It was partly why my dad had a stroke and then had health problems the rest of his life. But I'm sure you get that all the time. You have to do it for you, not because of horror stories and all that. I hope you get through it, though.
====================
SpeakerA: I had to leave my dog at the vet overnight, so they can run some tests. She hasn't been eating much lately, and she's just been really lackadaisical and lazy. I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight, knowing she's there in a weird environment, all alone
SpeakerB: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that, is she getting up there in age?
SpeakerA: She's almost 10, yeah. I know sometimes you just have to let go. But she was fine a few days ago! I'm still holding on to the idea that it's nothing. We'll see!
SpeakerB: Hopefully they will diagnose her correctly and she becomes her normal self. Fingers crossed!
====================
SpeakerA: I was mad when a check bounced my friend gave me. I knew he was shady
SpeakerB: Thats super sketchy of him.  I never accept checks from people.  Only cash. just in case
SpeakerA: I learned a lesson for sure
SpeakerB: hopefully you will still get the money
====================
SpeakerA: I can't believe my neighbors,  They are so rude.  I hope they move soon
SpeakerB: I do not like mine as well
SpeakerA: They always play music so loud and today they parked on my grass.  I want to complain but i don't want to start a fight
SpeakerB: That is annoying
====================
SpeakerA: I'm finally going to get to talk to a girl I contacted onine
SpeakerB: That sounds fun! Do you have a first date planned?
SpeakerA: haha I hope I get a date! We're just talking first.
SpeakerB: Ah okay, good plan. I'm sure she will go out with you. Just don't sound too desperate. 
====================
SpeakerA: I dropped off my car at the mechanic and he said it would cost $300.  I picked it up today and the bill was $3000 and he never asked if I wanted to go that high.
SpeakerB: I wish I had a car.
SpeakerA: I wish you had a car too.  Are you going to get one soon?
SpeakerB: Only if i find the money
====================
SpeakerA: I lost my grandmother's wedding ring.
SpeakerB: How did you do that can you remember the last place you had it? 
SpeakerA: I have no clue where it is.  I am so hurt about it.
SpeakerB: I know was it an important sentiment to your family? I hope it comes up eventually.
====================
SpeakerA: I'm really worried I screwed up at work and said something I shouldn't have. Now I can't stop thinking about it
SpeakerB: I bet it will be okay
SpeakerA: Yeah, I'm probably overthinking it, bad habit of mine.
SpeakerB: It happens to everyone
