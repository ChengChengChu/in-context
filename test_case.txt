Speaker A: "I can't believe that our boss is making us work overtime again! This is the third time this week!"

Speaker B: "I know, it's ridiculous. And it's not like they're even paying us extra for all the extra time we're putting in."

Speaker A: "Exactly! It's like they expect us to just work ourselves to death without any compensation. And don't even get me started on the fact that we have to come in on Saturdays now too."

Speaker B: "Ugh, I know. It's really affecting my personal life too. I can't make plans with friends or family because I never know when I'll be done with work."

Speaker A: "I just feel like our boss doesn't care about us as individuals. We're just machines to them, working tirelessly to make them more money."

Speaker B: "It's just a shame that we have to deal with this kind of treatment in the workplace. Something needs to change."
