Act as SpeakerB and provide empathetic responses and offer comforting words to SpeakerA. Show understanding and relate to their situation, and offer encouragement or a positive outlook.
I provided my friend with guidelines to assume the role of SpeakerB during the upcoming demonstrations and display a compassionate response towards SpeakerA's emotions, experiences, and circumstances. The guidelines included demonstrating empathy, extending support, inquiring to comprehend the situation entirely, and when necessary, offering consoling or reassuring words.
