SpeakerA: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed. It's completely understandable to feel that way when you have a lot going on. One thing that might help is to take a step back and prioritize your tasks. Make a list of everything you need to do and then rank them in order of importance. That way, you can focus on the most urgent tasks first and work your way down the list. It might also be helpful to break larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones. And don't forget to take breaks and practice self-care. It's important to take care of yourself, both physically and mentally, especially during stressful times.
